## Compatibility

`fast-agent` is compatible with the
[SEP-2640: Skills Extension](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/d7490ecd1a250f7bc8c3ebb0d65450dfec274bad/seps/2640-skills-extension.md)
**Draft** at revision
`d7490ecd1a250f7bc8c3ebb0d65450dfec274bad`
(`io.modelcontextprotocol/skills`). This is draft compatibility, not support for
a ratified MCP standard.

It supports that revision's `skills/list` and `skills/get` resource-manifest
flow, reading declared files with `resources/read`. Legacy servers that publish
`skill://index.json` entries as `skill-md` or archive artifacts are unsupported.

When a connected MCP server advertises this capability, `fast-agent` shows it as
an MCP-backed skills registry. Opening `/skills registry` calls the paginated
`skills/list` method. Installing a listed skill refreshes its entry with
`skills/get`, downloads every file named by its `resources` manifest through
`resources/read`, and requires each downloaded file to match its declared
SHA-256 digest before writing the local copy. Sidecar metadata records the
host-assigned MCP server identity, skill URI, and resource manifest.

!!! warning "Integrity is not trust"

    A successful SHA-256 check means the downloaded bytes match the manifest
    supplied by that MCP server. It does not authenticate the server or
    publisher, endorse the skill, or establish that its instructions are safe.
    Connect only to MCP servers you trust, and review installed skill content
    before enabling or using it.

Skill names are labels rather than identifiers. `fast-agent` preserves
same-named entries in an MCP listing and uses their URIs to disambiguate them.
The local managed skills directory can contain only one installed skill with a
given name. Because a server may return a partial or empty list, you can also
install a skill omitted from the listing when you know its URI:

```text
/skills add skill://acme/example/SKILL.md
```

The selected MCP server confirms that URI through `skills/get`. Every entry must
carry `resources`: either the complete `{uri, digest, size}` manifest of the
skill's files or the string `"dynamic"`. Dynamic skills are shown in listings but
cannot be installed, because their content has no digest manifest against which
to integrity-check it or compute an update revision. Skills that exceed the
SEP-2640 per-skill limits (512 resources or 16 MiB in total) are listed with the
reason but cannot be installed either. An entry that is invalid, for example one
with no `resources` at all, is skipped with a warning; the rest of the listing is
still used. Installed MCP skills live at `<server>--<name>` under the managed
skills directory so that same-named skills from different servers never collide.

## SDK status

The pinned MCP Python SDK does not yet provide typed SEP-2640 request and result
models. `fast-agent` therefore uses local wire models for `skills/list`,
`skills/get`, and the optional `resources/directory/read` method, matching
SEP-2640 Final. Those internal models may change when the SDK adds support.

## How the host applies SEP-2640

`fast-agent` installs an MCP skill as a managed local copy rather than loading it
on demand, and the following follow from that choice:

- Every file is fetched, size- and digest-checked, and written to disk at install
  time, after a fresh `skills/get` confirms the entry has not changed. The SEP's
  lazy-retrieval rule is not followed; the install is the user's explicit request
  for the whole skill.
- Installed skills live at `<server>--<name>` under the managed skills directory
  with a provenance sidecar naming the server and the verified content
  fingerprint. The fingerprint is recomputed every time skills are loaded, and a
  skill whose files changed after install is dropped with an error until it is
  updated or removed.
- A skill installed from an MCP server carries an `<origin>` element in the
  model's skill listing, and a same-named skill from another origin (the local
  filesystem or another server) is listed alongside it rather than replaced.
- `allowed-tools` and `hooks` are removed from every `SKILL.md` in an installed
  MCP skill, nested ones included. There is no per-skill approval gate on
  code-execution tool calls while the model is acting on an MCP skill; the SEP's
  "acting window" is not modelled.
- Digests are checked over the bytes `resources/read` returns. A file served as
  text is re-encoded as UTF-8 before hashing, so a server must serve any file
  that is not valid UTF-8 as a blob, or its digest will not match.
- A server's installed skills may total at most 200 MiB on disk. This is host
  policy, not a SEP limit. A `skills/list` longer than 10,000 entries or 1,000
  pages is truncated with a warning.

## Trying it

Run or connect to a server compatible with the pinned SEP-2640 draft above.
This example uses the hosted Hugging Face MCP Server:

```text
/mcp connect --name hf https://huggingface.co/mcp
/mcp
/skills registry
/skills available --registry hf
/skills search datasets --registry hf
/skills add <number|name> --registry hf
```

`/mcp` shows when a server advertises the
`io.modelcontextprotocol/skills` extension and points you to the one-shot
`/skills available --registry <server>` browse command. Use
`/skills registry <server>` when you want to make that server the active source
for subsequent skills commands.

Listings show `integrity: SHA-256 manifest; checked on install` when the server
supplies a complete resource manifest. A listing has not yet checked the served
file bytes.

## Current scope

This implementation uses MCP as an integrity-checked local-copy installer. It
does not expose MCP-served skill resources directly to the model or retain an
active MCP resource reader after installation. Installed content is an explicit
local copy, not a transparent MCP cache.

`/skills update` calls `skills/get` and compares the complete resource-set
revision with the installed revision. Any file addition, removal, URI change, or
digest change creates a new revision. Updates re-fetch the complete resource set
and SHA-256-check every file against the refreshed server manifest; this is not
publisher verification.
The top-level `fast-agent skills` CLI remains marketplace/file/GitHub oriented;
select MCP registries from an interactive session after connecting the MCP
server.
